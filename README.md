# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 03 Feb 2017

**Today's Progress:** Revamped my Github page using Jekyll with Hyde theme.

**Thoughts:** Different Jekyll themes have different layout coding style —
further complicating content insertion. Tried using Bootstrap but ended 
distorting all the styles.
