# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Designed "Centre Point" location card inspired by [this Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2144170-Day-014-Location-Card)

**Thoughts:** Earlier on the day: *while reading CSS* "Hmm.. This seems easy. I get this."

At the end of the day: *"hard-coding" CSS attribute* "Where does this tiny whitespace come from? WTH, where did my images go?"

Warning: Resize your browser at your own risk. Layout fiasco ahead!
