# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Designed "Centre Point" location card inspired by [this Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2144170-Day-014-Location-Card)

**Thoughts:** Earlier on the day: *while reading CSS* "Hmm.. This seems easy. I get this."

At the end of the day: *"hard-coding" CSS attribute* "Where does this tiny whitespace come from? WTH, where did my images go?"

Warning: Resize your browser at your own risk. Layout fiasco ahead!

### Day 2: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added halaman.php and komentar.php to manage pages and comments respectively on my personal CMS project. 

**Thoughts:** Establishing connection MySQL database through PHP is not as complex as I thought it would be. Still, I need to familiarize myself
with PHP syntax.

### Day 3: January 09, 2017

### Day 4: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another card for front-end practice. Inspired by [this shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2314157-Daily-UI-Day-1/attachments/439137)

**Thoughts:** Ah.. finally some responsive designs here and there (flexbox, em, vw). The values are derived by trial-and-error but it's a good start. Thinking of learning React or Angular next.

### Day 5: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practice makes perfect. Attempting to replicate [Airbnb's](https://airbnb.com) footer. 'Done'. But not responsive.

**Thoughts:** HTML5 Boilerplate gives a good start for web project. This project nudges me to use CSS preprocessor next time â€“ just look at my stylesheet housekeeping :/

One last thing: NEED TO STUDY RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN NITTY GRITTY DETAILS!

### Day 6: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some infos on the CMS dashboard and the media.php file to browse.. well, media

**Thoughts:** A modest progress. Far from what I expected. Damn it. I slacked a lot today. I need to commit myself to start learning React and the sort.

### Day 7: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I know tutorial doesn't count but finally arrived at React's front door, which means tasting Babel and ES6 first-hand

**Thoughts:** Argh, why must it be another weird syntax.. React oh React

### Day 8: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on @freeCodeCamp basic algo scripting. Also started learning web workflow, today I learned PostCSS 

**Thoughts:** I wonder if learning workflow / development stack would expand my software engineering skillset, but it is certainly being looked for in front-end dev candidates.
